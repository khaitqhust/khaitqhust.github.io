                    When's the last time you've had an Italian soda?
                    It had been a while for me,
                    but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and
                    I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup.
                    Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
                    carbonated water.
                    The Italian sodas at bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask;
                    I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times
                    when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

                    This place used to be Hydration when I went to college.
                    The interior looked more or less the same except the layout of the tables
                    and chairs.
                    It was busy when we came here for a drink after buying dinner nearby.
                    There were a lot of drinks on the menu as well as snack options.
